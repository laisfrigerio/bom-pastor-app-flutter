The Bom Pastor Institute is an organization located in the city of Piraquara (metropolitan region of Curitiba) and has several social initiatives, including the donation of food to the needy community and extracurricular activities for children and teenagers in the region.

The idea for the app came from a need at the institution: to create a gamified control system for the children and teenagers who are cared for by the Bom Pastor Institute. Students with the best behavior will earn points. These points are exchanged at the end of each month.
